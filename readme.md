# So Long

## Objectives

Itâ€™s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!<br><br>
so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.<br><br>
You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.<br><br>
The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.<br><br>

## Rules

+ The use the `MiniLibX` library is mandatory
+ `Makefile` must not relink
+ The program has to take as a parameter a map description file ending with the `.ber` extension

### Game

+ The player's goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape the shortest possible route
+ You can choose to use `W, A, S, D` || `ZQSD` || `arrow` keys to move the main character
+ The player should be able to move `UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT`
+ The player should not be able move into walls
+ At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell
+ You have to use a `2D view` (top-down or profile)
+ The game doesn't have to be real time

### Graphic management

+ The program has to display the image in a window
+ The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth)
+ Pressing `ESC` must close the window and quit the program in a clean way
