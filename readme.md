# So Long

## Objectives

It’s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!<br>
so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.<br>
You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.<br>
The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.
